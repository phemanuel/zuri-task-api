Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository without initializing it with a README or adding any .gitignore or license files. Copy the URL of your new GitHub repository.

Add GitHub Repository as a Remote:

Back in your terminal, add your GitHub repository as a remote with the following command (replace your-username and your-repository with your actual GitHub username and repository name):

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Push Your Project to GitHub:

Push your local project to the GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
If you're using a different branch, replace master with the branch name you want to push.

Authentication:

If you haven't authenticated with GitHub before using Git on your machine, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password or generate and use a personal access token. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication.

Verify on GitHub:

Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser, and you should see your Laravel project files there.
